# Value Proposition

The value proposition is listed in terms of impact followed by implementation. 
This is intended to focus on the "what" over the "how."
The approach is important in context of marking Leptos in terms:
- Leptos enables to you "make wishes come true"
- Leptos solves problems currently plaguing application developers. As a result, Leptos solves 
  problems for end users who need quality applications.

## Easy to use -> Low cognitive overhead
(fewer things to think about and remember)

- Same language across the whole framework/stack
- Static type checking provides superb code completion 


## Expressive -> Tools to build the apps you want
(you can build what you want)

- Structure and compose your applications with a simple component library
- 
- Simple UI component structure to build your applications 
- Iteration components allow for easy UI repetition
- Asynchronous components allow for fetching and fallbacks that write like HTML


## Dependable -> Reduced frustration and anxiety from unwanted surprises
(you can build with confidence)

- Solve problems at compile time, not runtime, with static type checking
- Test your code easily with Rust's built 


## Portability -> Rust is a language that can deploy to any platform


## Consistent -> Low cognitive overhead
- Static type checking ensures
