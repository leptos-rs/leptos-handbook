# Value Proposition

The value proposition is listed in terms of impact followed by implementation. It should be 
noted that the weighting to these values will differ by demographic.

The following list is intended to focus on "what" over "how," with emphasis on two key 
types of messages that we can communicate:

1) Leptos enables to you "make wishes come true"
2) Leptos solves problems currently plaguing application developers. As a result, Leptos solves 
  problems for end users who need quality applications.

> It is recommended that the following should be reviewed in context with the [objectives](.
/objectives.md) to asses validity.

## Easy to use -> Low cognitive overhead
(fewer things to think about and remember)

- Same language across the whole framework/stack
- Static type checking provides superb code completion 


## Expressive -> Tools to build the apps you want
(you can build what you want)

- Create complex layouts/interactions and organize your application with a great component system
- Repeat layouts with easy to use component repeaters/iterators
- Automatically update content with interaction thanks to there reactive system, derived 
  signals, etc
- Easily load content from anywhere with simple fallbacks thanks to the async suspense pipeline


## Dependable -> Reduced frustration and anxiety from unwanted surprises
(you can build with confidence)

- Solve problems at compile time, not runtime, with static type checking
- Test your code easily with Rust's built 


## Portability -> Rust is a language that can deploy to any platform
(write once run almost anywhere)

- Code in rust can be compiled to almost any target language. Build your app and hook it into 
  Leptos for the UI.


## Consistent -> Low cognitive overhead
(build it once)

- Fewer surprises and fewer bugs make more enjoyable applications to write, use, and maintain 


## Performant -> Low cost, high availability
(run it forever, keep it green)

- Applications that are easier to use and run on lower hardware are inclusive and ecologically 
  friendly
