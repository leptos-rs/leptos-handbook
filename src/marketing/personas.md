# Personas

Personas are currently outlined as demographics. It is recommended to poll the community to 
develop additional actual personas.

## For each audience we will want to look at:

- What does Rust do differently from the demographic's language
- What does Rust do better (more easily/consistently/performantly) from the demographic's language
- What does Leptos do differently from the demographic's framework
- What does Leptos do better (more easily/consistently/performantly) than the demographic's 
  framework

## Demographics to investigate:

- Full stack javascript developers
- Front end javascript developers
- Backend javascript developers
- PHP and other web tech developers
- New web developers
- Systems developers who want a front end
