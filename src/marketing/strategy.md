# Strategy

The Leptos marketing strategy focuses on inspiring developers and early adopters. 
See the [marketing personas](./personas.md) for how this strategy may apply to different 
cohorts and user groups.
The expected path to adoption/use ([our objectives](./objectives.md)) is to reach many users 
through communication of the [value proposition](./value_proposition.md) to early adopter 
developers. Those developers will in turn encourage others in their community to use Leptos, 
including management at their place(s) of work. 

The strategy works in two phases:

1 - Communicate values to developers relative to their hierarchy of needs
2 - Educate developers to communicate the value of Leptos to their organizations/places of 
business framed in the context of business concerns.

> The Leptos brand, while not ignoring pain points, should focus on using positive solution 
> oriented language instead of language that creates fear responses or uses anxiety as a 
> marketing tool. It is recommended that pain points should be discussed indirectly so that 
> they aren't associated with Leptos, while communicating how Leptos avoids them.

## 1) Developer needs
A developer's needs are approached from the context of thinking about one self. They are rooted 
in the need to *avoid pain and create joy.*

As such Leptos weights these developer needs as (in order of priority/impact/importance):

- Reduce pain
  - Pain from complexity (the problem is too big to fit in one's mind)
  - Pain from lack of agency (the inability to build what you want or paralysis from complexity)
  - Pain from things breaking and complains (peer group disapproval)
  - Pain from obligation (needing to keep working on a project because velocity is required 
    for progress. See complexity)
- Create joy
  - Joy from creating with tools that empower
  - Joy from building applications that enrich lives (through capability or building a business 
    around them)
  - Joy from tools that are approachable, creating a more attainable flow state
  - Joy from the comfort of consistency where an application always runs the same way every time

## 2) Business needs
A business is less likely to be concerned about DX and more likely to be concerned about impact 
of the software against the bottom line. Their hierarchy of needs and focus differ greatly from 
those of developers. Business needs are focused on *avoid expenses/cost and create revenue.*

Leptos weights these business needs as (in order of importance for current business adopters):

- Capable - Able to build complex applications
- High velocity - Build quickly, ideally without the "get it done" roughness of most MVPs
- Low cost to operate - Reduce operating revenue requirements
- Portable/Performant - Deploy easily and close to users
- Safe/Reliable - Runs consistently without surprises or required oversight
- Low risk - Easy to onboard and find developers for

## Time
Technology is a tool that exists over time and Leptos should be presented as being aware of how 
software and time are coupled. Developers and businesses are creating an investment in Leptos 
and the trajectory of that investment should be outlined.

For developers:
- Leptos is easy to learn even with Rust's complexity
- Leptos is a gateway to learning Rust (produces other value)
- Leptos makes building a simple application easy
- Leptos makes building a complex application easy
- Leptos makes continued development enjoyable and scalable

For businesses:
- Leptos is easy for staff to learn
- Leptos allows for partial adoption
- Leptos investments can yield full stack applications to serve all business needs
- Rust allows for code to be written once and used anywhere
- Leptos creates stable revenue generating applications that are easy to maintain (low 
  developer cost/time due to consistency, low operating cost due to performance)
