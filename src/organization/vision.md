Notes for it include:

- Progressively enhance all browser features and core browser behaviours?
- Effortlessly move functionality or trigger functionality from/on the server/client
- Performantly render complex applications with ease, efficiency, and low complexity
- Create a framework that we're all excited to work on and are enthusiastic to use
