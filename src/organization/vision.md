# Vision

The vision for Leptos has yet to be solidified.

Notes for it include:

- Progressively enhance all browser features and core browser behaviours?
- Effortlessly move functionality or trigger functionality from/on the server/client
- Performantly render complex applications with ease, efficiency, and low complexity
- Create a framework that we're all excited to work on and are enthusiastic to use

## Questions to answer for planning the vision (the goal of our roadmap)
What does complete look like?
When would we be happy?
Which problems need to be solved?
What do all aspects look like at our few year goal (community, cargo-leptos, clientside, native
apps, etc)?
