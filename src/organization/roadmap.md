# Roadmap

End goal of Leptos has yet to be determined. @gbj will need to express the direction he'd like 
to take. This should chart a path of features and initiatives to take us from where we are to 
the objectives and "vision."

Future features:
- I want to build something like server components in the next year or so: ie async components guaranteed to run only on the server, integrated seamlessly with the router so you donâ€™t notice. (Similar to islands architecture or React server components)
- Accessibility linting via the language server or view macro
- Built in support for some static site generation features would be cool
