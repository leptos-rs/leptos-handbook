# Values

The values for Leptos have yet to be solidified.

Notes for it include:

- Openness and approachability (in terms of community and code)
- Clarity and consistency
- Use the least powerful and simplest tool/solution available
- Allow progressive enhancement
- Hold as few opinions about non-framework use cases as possible
